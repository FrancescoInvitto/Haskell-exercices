# Haskell-exercises
A collection of Haskell exercises developed during the "Paradigmi e linguaggi per l'analisi dei dati" (Paradigms and languages for data analysis) course of master degree at University of Parma.

# How to execute Haskell code
In order to execute the Haskell programs you can install Haskell on your machine (see: [How to install Haskell][https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20installed%20the,WinGHCi%20in%20the%20Start%20menu.&text=And%20you%20are%20presented%20with,now%20attentively%20awaits%20your%20input.]) or use an online tool (I used the one at the following link: [https://replit.com/])

## Using Replit
Follow these steps:
  1. save your code with .hs extension.
  2. load the file in the console
  ```console
  :l filename.hs
  ```
  3. write the name of the function you want to execute
  ```ghci
  function param1 param2
  ```
